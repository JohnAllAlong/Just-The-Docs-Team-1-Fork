# Team Git Workflow

Git workflows are methods or procedures that dictate how developers interact with the
Git system to achieve effective team collaboration.

Some of the popular workflows used by teams are:
- Centralized Workflow
- Feature Branch Workflow
- Forking Workflow



# Centralized Workflow

All developers work directly on a single branch, often main or master .
Simple and similar to Subversion-style workflows.
Not as powerful or flexible as other workflows.
Suitable for small teams and projects.
Merging can be problematic.
