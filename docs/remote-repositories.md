# Remote Repositories

A *remote repository* is a version of your project that is hosted on a remote server.

It can **interact** with **local repositories**, allowing you to push your
changes to others and pull their changes to your local repository.


### Introduction to GitHub

*GitHub* is a hosting platform for Git repositories owned by
Microsoft.

It provides a **web-based interface** to interact with your repositories and adds social and collaboration features.

### Some Remote Repo / GitHub Terminology:
- **Push**: Send your changes to a remote repository.
- **Pull**: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository into your current branch.
- **Clone**: Make a full copy of a repository at its current state.
- **Fork**: Create a copy of someone else's repository in your own GitHub account.
