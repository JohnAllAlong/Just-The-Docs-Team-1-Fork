### Here is some basic Git info to get you started:

## The Role of Version Control in Software Development

**Version control**, also known as **revision control** or **source control**, is the
management of changes to documents like computer programs.

CTRL-Z is the simplest form of version control.

**Some documents have more advanced version control built-in:**
- Microsoft Word has a "Track Changes" feature.
- Google Docs automatically tracks file changes over.
- You can see the edit history of all Wikipedia articles.
([Here's the history of the version control article.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Version_control&action=history))

## More Than Just Undo

### **Version control allows for more than just undoing things:**
- Work on new projects features while at the same time patching bugs found in older
  version of the code.
- Collaborate with someone on a projects without overwriting each other's work.
- Work with distributed teams of coders from around the world to develop open-
  source applications.

## Why Should I Care About Version Control?
Solo or team, version control is your secret weapon for efficient and stress-free
software development.
 It's your development safety net!

## What is Git?
### Summary
**Git** is a free and open source version control system, popular for use with open source projects.

## A Brief History of Git
- The Git version control tool was created by Linus Torvalds, the same coder who created the Linux OS.
- Git development started when Bitkeeper, the version control tool being used for Linux development, revoked it's free license for Linux development.
- Development on Git started in April 2005, and by June it was already being used to handle the next Linux kernel release!

## Advantages of Git
- Git is free and open source
- Git helps us keep track of the changes to our -source code over the lifespan of a project.
- When combined with cloud version control sites like GitHub or GitLab, we can use git to collaborate with others remotely.
- With Git, you can make a "commit", or a save point, as often as you'd like.
- You can also go back to previous commits. This takes the pressure off of you while you're working.
- Commit often and commit early, and you'll never have that gut sinking feeling of overwriting or losing changes.
- Allows us to work offline if necessarily and synchronize with a distributed team.

## Disadvantages of Git (for game development)
- Not especially user friendly for non-developers.
- No built-in support for large repos, although the [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) add-on exists.
- No built-in support for locking binary assets. (Locking can be enabled with Git LFS.)
