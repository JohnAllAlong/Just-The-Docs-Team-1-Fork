This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

Start by following the instructions in the [README] and then [browse the Just the Docs documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

Remember that you will be using [Markdown Syntax] rather than raw HTML to format the content of your pages.
